Reaching out and finding help
=============================

**Please be invited to reach out and discuss any questions or ideas you have, or changes you would like to make**: We are happy to answer your questions!

Our `Slack channel`_ is always available for **quick questions** -- we try to be around as much as possible. For long-term **proposals, more formal technical discussions and bug reports**, please use `GitHub issues`_. You are also welcome to drop the main contributors a line or two by email if you prefer.
